# ⚔️ Vindicta Oracle

*Predictive Models & Strategic Meta Analysis.*

The Oracle Domain provides the AI-driven foresight of the Vindicta Platform. It evaluates army lists, predicts match outcomes, and resolves complex strategic debates through a multi-agent consensus system.

## 🏛️ Core Components

- **Debate Engine**: Multi-agent system where different tactical personas (Tech-Priest, Chaos Sorcerer, etc.) debate game mechanics.
- **List Grader**: Automated evaluation of competitive army lists against current meta-trends.
- **Outcome Predictor**: Statistical models for win probability and tactical risk assessment.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

This repository is managed with `uv`.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the debate engine demo
uv run src/vindicta_oracle/demo.py
```

## 📦 Architecture
