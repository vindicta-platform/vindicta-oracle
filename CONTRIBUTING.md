## Cross-Cutting Decisions

> **⚠️ Important:** All decisions that affect multiple repositories or have platform-wide implications **must** be recorded in [**Platform-Docs**](https://github.com/vindicta-platform/Platform-Docs) before implementation.

This includes:
- API contract changes
- Shared schema modifications
- Authentication/authorization changes
- New inter-service dependencies
- Platform-wide configuration changes

See the [Platform-Docs Contributing Guide](https://github.com/vindicta-platform/Platform-Docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full process.

## Repo-Specific Guidelines

1. Follow existing code style and conventions
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Keep PRs focused and atomic
4. Reference related [Platform-Docs proposals](https://github.com/vindicta-platform/Platform-Docs/tree/main/docs/proposals) when applicable
